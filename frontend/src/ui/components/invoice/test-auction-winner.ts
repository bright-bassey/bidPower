/**
 * Invoice & Payment Functionality Tests
 * 
 * These manual tests can be run to verify the invoice and payment functionality:
 * 
 * 1. Create an auction room and set a short duration (e.g., 5 minutes)
 * 2. Join the room with two different users in two different browsers
 * 3. Have both users place bids, with one user being the highest bidder
 * 4. Wait for the auction to end or simulate ending it
 * 5. Verify that the highest bidder sees:
 *    - A "Congratulations! You won this auction" message
 *    - The AuctionWinnerController component showing a button to view the invoice
 *    - Clicking the button shows the InvoiceModal
 *    - The invoice details are correct (amount, tax, etc.)
 *    - The Pay Now button works
 * 
 * Test that all the following scenarios work:
 * - Auction ends naturally (timer reaches zero)
 * - Auction is already closed when winner loads the page
 * - User disconnects and reconnects while being the highest bidder
 * - Browser is refreshed after winning
